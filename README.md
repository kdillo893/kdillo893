- 👋 Hi, I’m @kdillo893
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, disc golf, and recently learning guitar
- 🌱 I’m currently dabbling in numerous side projects to gain experience with various tools and languages (selenium drivers with Java and Python, standard libraries in C, SQLite for small database for recording info, WebGL for graphics understanding, Web Audio APIs and graphing tools for frequency analysis, etc.).
    I'm refreshing fundamental knowledge in front-end technologies (HTML/CSS/JS) in order to prepare myself to teach new developers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: kdillo893@gmail.com
