- 👋 Hi, I’m @kdillo893
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, disc golf, and recently learning guitar
- 🌱 I’m currently dabbling in numerous side projects to gain experience with various tools and languages (Selenium drivers with Java and Python, standard libraries in C, SQLite for a small database for recording info, WebGL for graphics understanding, Web Audio APIs, and graphing tools for frequency analysis, etc.).
    I'm refreshing my fundamental knowledge of front-end technologies (HTML/CSS/JS) and trying to make tools for efficient job searching.
- 💞️ I would be willing to collaborate on projects of interest. I will join Discord servers or communities for projects that interest me.
- 📫 How to reach me: kdillo893@gmail.com
